Versus computer

add button to select vs computer or vs human
    state tracks whether playing human or pc
        event listener on button
            switch game mode state
            creates a new empty grid
            set player 2 name to computer 


in handleClick function
    check if pc game mode is active
        if it's active => follow computer game logic
            else follow human game logic



STILL NEEDED: 

computer logic
tie logic
disable form when playing computer
disable form and game type buttons once game is started
refactor vs computer logic => use a helper function
